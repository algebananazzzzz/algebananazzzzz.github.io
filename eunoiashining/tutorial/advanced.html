      <h1 id="item-1-1" class="mt-4">Using the resume template</h1>
      <p>"Don't reinvent the wheel"</p>
      <img src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/uploads/2009/02/6a0120a85dcdae970b0120a86df78c970b-pi.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="">

      <p class="mt-4 text-justify">Building a webpage from scratch usually involves coding thousands of lines, and most likely, without proper design thinking etc., you'll end up creating a square wheel that makes the user go :< There are existing
          css frameworks, most prominently being Bootstrap that allows you to quickly build user friendly webpages, as people has thought together and put together resources to create these frameworks. And yes, like how we dress differently for
          different occasions, it's important for webpages to have proper CSS for different purposes. Like how we dress differently for different occasions, different webpages require different CSS for different purposes, which bootstrap takes care
          of it by providing free themes for it. </p>
          <p>Okay enough theory. Go to this website and download the resume theme.</p>
          <div class="alert alert-primary mb-5" role="alert">
            <p>
              For this tutorial's purpose, due to time constrains, I will provide in depth tutorial on this design:
              <br>
              <a href="https://startbootstrap.com/theme/resume">This resume design</a>
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>
              But still, no hard rules. If you managed to find a better template, go for it!!
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p class="mb-0"> <a href="https://startbootstrap.com/?showPro=false&showAngular=false&showVue=false" class="alert-link">This is where</a> I find other themes for other purposes.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>After you have downloaded, unzip and open the index.html file using notepad, and open the same file in the browser. You can edit your webpage by this way, and view changes at the same time.</p>
          <h1 id="item-1" class="mt-4">So how??</h1>
          <p>Okay in this section, i can't really help you much, it's your resume, and perhaps you aren't certified by Google (hire me if u are), or went to university, only you'll know what to write. But as a rule of thumb, you can refer to what the
            guy/girl who developed this template wrote. Good luck!! I'm signing off :))
          </p>
          <p>
            On second thought, lemme just give you some suggestions on what to change yea?? If you don't understand how to do it or messed up something, do not languish, spare time for self care then feel free to consult me cuz i won't bite!! Woof.
            <br>
            And one more thing, if you wanna add something else not in this list (pictures, links, popouts just really anything), feel more than free to ask me, I'll try my very best to make it happen, it'll honestly make me feel really happy :))
          </p>
          <h5>Things to change (spam use control f)</h5>
          <h6>1. Title of webpage
            <br>2. Favicon of webpage
            <br>3. Your name
            <br>4. The paragraphs detailing your achievements
            <br>5. Links to your github account/email. For me, I'll feel uncomfty putting too many socials on my resume, so I only added email and github.
            <br>6. The skills page. You can remove the icons and copy paste the paragraphs on the above sections down.
            <br>7. Image of the hairy man. You may wanna delete/replace it.
            <br>8. Font styling of your resume, color of sidebar.
          </h6>
          <p>Do refer to the introduction to html/css pages for reference on how to do these.</p>
          <p>For reference, here's <a href="https://algebananazzzzz.github.io/" target="_blank">my own resume</a> you can refer to! Sorry my bad I'm still working on the last few sections (trying some new layout) so I didn't include it for now.</p>
